# NutritionTrackerApp
Nutrition tracker android app for macros and micros. Similar to MyFitnessPal, but more like I like it. It's simple and efficient.

- The program works offline(no internet connection need) except for getting new foods with a link like [this](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3086/2)
- It allows you to config your data more manually before actually using it (that is, before you can calculate your macros and micros for the day or the macros and micros of a meal per example, you're supposed to have some data to work with). By data I mean your individual foods and meals, and it's macros and micros, ammounts, price, etc. You can edit these by directly accessing the foods and meals data
- The data is stored in the phone's local DB for the app.

Open using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio))
